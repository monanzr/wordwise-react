# WordWise

## Description

"WordWise" is a project that utilizes React, React Router, Context API with useReducer, and Leaflet to create an engaging web application for tracking and documenting personal adventures and travels.

This is a code along project that was made while watching The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More by Jonas Schmedtmann


## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides the foundation for creating interactive components and managing the application's state.
- React Router: A routing library that enables navigation and URL handling in a React application. It allows for seamless navigation between different pages or views within the application.
- Context API with useReducer: The Context API is a part of React that allows for global state management and sharing data between components without the need for prop drilling. The useReducer hook is used in conjunction with the Context API to manage complex state logic in a predictable and scalable way.
- Leaflet: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. Leaflet provides a lightweight and customizable solution for displaying maps, markers, and other geographical features in the "WordWise" project, enhancing the user experience and enabling the tracking and documentation of personal adventures and travels.
